# python-learning-log
**Documenting my learning process in Python for scientific computing, with an emphasis on data science, astrophysics and research applications.** 
## About This Repository
This repository serves as a structured log of my ongoing development in Python programming. It complements my formal coursework and independent research interests in astrophysics, data science, and scientific communication.

My aim is to demonstrate not only technical proficiency but also the ability to learn independently, document clearly, and apply programming in interdisiplinary scientific contexts.
## Current Coursework 
**Python for Everybody** - University of Michigan (Coursera)

Instructor: Dr. Charles Severance 

Topics Covered: Python fundamentals, data structures, web data retrieval, databases, and data visualization. 
## Repository Structure
