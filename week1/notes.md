# Why Program 1.1
- Computers are designed to do things for us. However, we need to speak their language in order to tell it to do things.
- Programmers anticipate needs.
- Think of yourself as living inside the computer.
- A program is like a sequence of stored instructions.
- Human program example: Dance instructions for the macarana.
- People make errors and sometimes our brains fix them, but **computers don't**.
- Therefore, these are considered **bugs**, and the computer will see these as **syntax error** and will quit.
