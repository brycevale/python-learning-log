# Module 1 Notes : Why We Program & Syllabus 
**Course Syllabus** 

Learn how to construct a program from a series of simple python instructions.

Covers chapters 1-5 of the "Python for Everybody" textbook. 

Will be learning Python 3

There will be 7 assignments and 5 Quizzes 

**Submitting Assignments**

Submitted to an Autograder

Output must match exactly, including capitalizations and spaces to be considered correct.

# Why Program 1.1
- Computers are designed to do things for us. However, we need to speak their language in order to tell it to do things.
- Programmers anticipate needs.
- Think of yourself as living inside the computer.
- A program is like a sequence of stored instructions.
- Human program example: Dance instructions for the macarana.
- People make errors and sometimes our brains fix them, but **computers don't**.
- Therefore, these are considered **bugs**, and the computer will see these as **syntax error** and will quit. 
# Hardware Overview 1.2 
**vocab**
- **Central Processing Unit**: (CPU) a circut with millions of transistors that asks **whats next?** and gets the answers out of the memory.
- **Main Memory**: Fast small temporary storage - lost on reboot - aka RAM
- **Secondary Memory**: Slower large permanent storage - lasts until deleted (ex: usb stick) 
- **Input and Output Devices**: the way the computer accesses the outside world. (ex: mouse, or keyboard are input. screen or speakers are output)
# Python as a Language 1.3 
- Pythonistas: Those who can read or write Python language
- **Guido van Rossum**: invented the Python language
- Name has nothing to do with snakes, but based on Monty Pythons Flying Circus (so it seemed less serious and more enjoyable)
- Designed to be your first programming language but still be powerful
- You will see a lot of Syntax Errors over your time coding but it doesn't mean you're bad at programming. It means that Python is lost.
