## 1.4 Writing Paragraphs of Code 
---
**Vocab**
- Reserved Words: You cannot use **reserved words** as variable names / Identifiers
- Like how dogs may know "treat", "walk", "outside", etc. But they don't know others
  - false     
  - none    
  - true      
  - and   
  - as       
  - assert
  - async
  - await
  - break
  - class
  - continue
  - def
  - del
  - elif
  - else
  - except
  - finally
  - for
  - from
  - global
  - if
  - import
  - in
  - is
  - lambda
  - nonlocal
  - not
  - or
  - pass
  - raise
  - return
  - try
  - while
  - with
  - yield

  ## Sentences or Lines
  x = 2 <--- Assignment statement
  
  x = x + 2 <--- Assignment with expression
  
  print(x) <--- Print Function

  Variables: all the x's
  
  Operator: the = and +
  
  Constant: the 2's
  
  Function: print()

  ## Pthon Scripts
Interactive Python is good for 3-4 lines long 

Most are a lot longer so type them in a **file** or text editor and then you can run commands

It's like giving python a **script** 

end the file with .py so it knows it contains python

## Program Steps or Program Flow 
**Sequential Steps**: when a program is running it flows from one step to the next, we give it a path to follow 

Example:

x = 2

print (x)

x = x + 2

print (x) 

**Conditional Steps**: (if --> then)

Example:

x = 5

if x < 10
 
  - print ('Smaller')

if x > 20:
  
  - print('bigger')

print('Finis")

So: if the number is 5 like in this it would show smaller, if the number is 25 it would show bigger, but if its inbetween like 15 then it will skip and show finis

**Repeated Steps**: Loops (repeated steps) have **iteration variables** that change each time through a loop 

Example:

n = 5 

while n > 0:
 
  - print(n)   ________________Output:5-1
    
  - n = n - 1

print('blastoff!')  ________________Output: Blastoff!

So: it continues with the output and will print 5, 4, 3, 2 , 1 then is looped back again and when its 0 then no longer true and will leave the loop and down to blastoff
